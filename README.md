# Parakeet Lip Sync

Parakeet Lip Sync is an automatic lip-syncing tool that helps to create 2d mouth animations from the audio recordings.  

It is inspired from the existing lip-sync softwares like Papagayo, Yolo and Rhubarb.

This project is under development. Don't be suprised if it crashes, burns, eats your lunch, or fails to behave as it's supposed to.

A video tutorial on how to use Parakeet Lip sync is coming soon.
