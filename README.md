# Parakeet Lip Sync

Parakeet Lip Sync is an automatic lip-syncing tool that helps to create 2d mouth animations from the audio recordings.  

It is inspired from the existing lip-sync softwares like Papagayo, Yolo and Rhubarb.

This project is under development. Don't be suprised if it crashes, burns, eats your lunch, or fails to behave as it's supposed to.

## Todos for the project

- [x] A very minimalistic GUI.
- [ ] Automatic lip-sync.
- [ ] A MouthView to view the generated output.
- [ ] A WaveformView to edit the generated output.
